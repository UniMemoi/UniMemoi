Wireless Transmission
Mobile users requires a mobility enabled network - contrast with the wired networks 
Wireless networks can provide advantages even in fixed location environments
"There are many types of wireless data transmission networks, but they all have a common basis – electromagnetic wave propagation"
Unlike previous mediums wireless signals are broadcasted over a region
Potential signal collisions >> Need regulations
[page 3]
Electromagnetic Spectrum
Variety of sets of frequencies are for different things:
Radio: wide-area broadcast; 
Infrared/Light: line-of-sight 
Microwave: LANs and 3G/4G;

ElectroMagnetic (EM) Spectrum

"Number of oscillations per second of a wave is called frequency, measured in Hertz (Hz)."
Distance between two consecutive minima or maxima is called wavelength.
All EM waves travel at same speed (speed of light)
Fundamental relationship:
Wavelength x Frequency = Speed of Light
Units: (m) x (1/s) = (m/s)

Wireless vs. Wires/Fiber
Wireless:
Easy and inexpensive to deploy
Naturally supports mobility
Naturally supports broadcast
Transmissions interfere and must be managed
Signal strengths hence data rates vary greatly
Wires/Fiber:
Easy to engineer a fixed data rate over point-to-point links
"Can be expensive to deploy, esp. over distances"
Doesn’t readily support mobility or broadcast

Communication Satellites
Satellites are effective for broadcast distribution and anywhere/anytime communications
Kinds of Satellites 
Geostationary (GEO) Satellites 
Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) Satellites 
Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites 
""
Satellites vs. Fiber is a key comparison
""
[page 7]
Kinds of Satellites
"Satellites and their properties vary by altitude: Geostationary (GEO), Medium-Earth Orbit, (MEO), and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO)"
[page 8]
Geostationary Satellites
"GEO satellites orbit 35,000 km above a fixed location"
VSAT (computers) can communicate with the help of a hub
"Different bands (L, S, C, Ku, Ka) in the GHz are in use but may be crowded or susceptible to rain."

Low-Earth Orbit Satellites

Systems such as Iridium use many low-latency satellites for coverage and route communications via them
<img src='image_on_page9.png' />
The Iridium satellites form six necklaces around the earth.

Satellite vs. Fiber
Satellite:
Can rapidly set up anywhere/anytime communications (after satellites have been launched)
Can broadcast to large regions
Limited bandwidth and interference to manage 
Fiber:
Enormous bandwidth over long distances
Installation can be more expensive/difficult

Who found out Electromagnetic Waves?
<img src='image_on_page12.jpg' />
<img src='image_on_page12.jpg' />
Electromagnetism was first predicted by Maxwell
<img src='image_on_page12.jpg' />
<img src='image_on_page12.jpg' />
Later Hertz has proved they exist
His name is used as a unit of frequency now

Origins of Electrical Signals
<img src='image_on_page13.jpg' />
Electromagnetic induction is at the origins of putting signals on to a wire
""
Michael Faraday is the father of this

But How Bits Look as a Signal
"Information on wire transmitted by varying a physical property e.g., voltage, current etc"
"Generating a periodic function is needed, imagine a simple Sine function for example"
"E.g., the sine function: c*sin(ax+b): "
"Three things can change the behaviour of this function: c: Amplitude, a:Frequency and b:Phase"
[page 19]
""
"Change in Amplitude, Frequency, & Phase"
Change in Amplitude
Change in Frequency
Change in Phase
[page 20]
Modulation is the term used
"Modulating the amplitude, frequency/phase of a carrier signal sends bits in a (non-zero) frequency range"
[page 21]
What Kind of Links We Can Have
Full-duplex link
Used for transmission in both directions at once
"e.g., use different twisted pairs for each direction"
Half-duplex link
"Both directions, but not at the same time"
"e.g., senders take turns on a channel "
Simplex link
Only one fixed direction at all times; not common in communications
[page 22]
Multiplexing is used for sharing
When multiple sources want to put things on to a medium
